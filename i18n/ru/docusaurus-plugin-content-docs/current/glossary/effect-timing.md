hoverText: Effects must be resolved one at a time. Each effect must be completely resolved before resolving the next effect.

Some abilities have effects that depend on others for timing or have multiple effects. These abilities are resolved following the rules below:

- Effects must be resolved one at a time. Each effect must be completely resolved before resolving the next effect.
  - A "when" effect is resolved immediately when the triggering event occurs.
  - An "after" effect is resolved immediately following the triggering event.
  - A "before" effect is resolved immediately before the triggering event.
- If different effects are resolved with the same timing, the players decide the order in which those effects are resolved.
- Some abilities have multiple effects with the same timing, such as the Purge skill in the [Restoring Light](/docs/adventurer/skill-lines/mage/restoring-light) skill line. If some of these effects can be resolved and others cannot, the effects that can be resolved are resolved. Effects that cannot be resolved are ignored.
